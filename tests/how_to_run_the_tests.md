Tests are meant to be run with ` pytest`.

Run all tests
-------------

In a terminal in this directory, run the following command:
```
pytest -s
```
No error nor failure should arise.

Run a single test
-----------------

For example, you want to test `utils.py`. In a terminal in this directory, run the following command:
```
pytest test_utils.py
```
